## Project objective:
The final part of your learning phase as an AAVAIL data scientist will require you to customize and deploy a model that fits a very specific business need. You will be asked to create a revenue projection tool that will be used by managers and executives at your company.

## Project hill:
A hill is a statement that  allows a group to focus on a particular goal.  Hills are statements  organized according to the principle of “who, what, wow”.
    Who are the end users that will benefit.
    What are the end users doing or trying to accomplish
    Wow, what is the new aspect that will be developed to help them achieve their goal

In this case, we have two hills that have been specified, one for the  end users and one for the managers. The end user hill statement is:

Our customers will be able to subscribe and pay for AAVAIL  services by combining any services they desire and being charged only  for those services.

The manager statement reads as follows:

**AAVAIL product managers will be able to project a particular country’s revenue for the following month using a machine learning model  that will provide revenue estimates and confidence measures for those  estimates.**
